  firstName: ‚ÄúJack‚Äù,

  strengths: ['creative', 'quick learner', 'great communicator']
}

Having spent the last decade training and working in academia in the field of English Literature, I recently took the bold decision to retrain and seek a new career in Tech. I‚Äôve always been an intuitive and creative individual and, realising that academia wasn‚Äôt for me, was attracted by the impactful and problem-solving nature of software development. I recently completed a part-time, self-paced full stack software development course with \_nology.io and can showcase a growing portfolio of projects.

I‚Äôm certainly not your average junior developer. That being said, my academic background means that I have exceptionally strong critical thinking, communication and research skills, and I tend to bring an element of creative flair to any project that I'm a part of. Check out what I've been learning and working on below!
