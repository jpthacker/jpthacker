  firstName: "Jack",

  background: "PhD in English Literature",

  strengths: ['creative', 'quick learner', 'great communicator']
}
```

Iâ€™m a junior web developer specializing in the front end (but donâ€™t worry, I have a few back end tricks up my sleeve as well). I recently completed a part-time software developer course with _nology.io and Iâ€™m now proficient in Javascript (ES6), React, CSS/SCSS and HTML5 and familiar with range of key approaches such as OOP, TDD and Agile.

Iâ€™m looking to develop my skills further in a fulfilling front end role in the Tech sector, where I hope to apply my creative flair and people skills, as well as my technical experience, to produce impactful and beautiful applications. 

I have a background in academia and the humanities, which means that I'm an exceptionally strong critical thinker and communicator, and I tend to bring an element of original thinking and creative flair to any project that Iâ€™m a part of. 

I can boast a growing portfolio of project that make use of a range of in-demand technologies. Check out what I've been learning and working on below!
